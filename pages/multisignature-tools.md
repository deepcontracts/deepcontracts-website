7. **Non-Profit Organizations**: Charitable funds can be held in multisig addresses, ensuring that donations are used for their intended purpose with trustee oversight.
8. **Cold Storage Solutions**: Individuals can store their long-term holdings in a multisig wallet, using distributed keys to reduce the risk of theft or loss.
